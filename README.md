# DSA

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms practice.
I will be adding Google Colab notebooks, code snippets, and problem solutions here as I learn and practice.

## Contents
- Notebook – Colab notebooks for DSA problems
- Code– Standalone `.ipynb` files for algorithms and data structure implementations
- Notes– Trainer from Techademy

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab

##  Goals
- Practice DSA problems regularly
- Implement common algorithms from scratch
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming
